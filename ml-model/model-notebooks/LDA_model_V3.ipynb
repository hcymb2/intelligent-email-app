    "1. If you used the internet today, you probably used NGINX. It's a powerful web server that most major websites use to handle traffic. And freeCodeCamp just published a free full-length NGINX book that will show you how to use this web server tool for routing, reverse proxying, and even load balancing. (2 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-nginx-handbook/ \\\n",
    "2. You can also learn the MERN Stack by building your own Yelp-like restaurant review site. MERN stands for MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js. Then in the second half of the course, you'll learn how to swap out your Node.js/Express back end in favor of Serverless Architecture. (3 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-mern-stack-app-with-a-serverless-backend/\\\n",
    "3. Learn how to create your own 3D graphics using OpenGL. You'll work with polygons, textures, shaders, and other important rendering tools. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-3d-and-2d-graphics-with-opengl-and-cpp/\\\n",
    "4. If you're learning Python, I encourage you to bookmark this. Prolific teacher and developer Estefania walks you through dozens of Python syntax examples that all beginners should learn. Data structures, loops, exception handling, dependency inclusion – everything. (90 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-code-examples-sample-script-coding-tutorial-for-beginners/\\\n",
    "5. And while you're expanding your Python skills, you can learn how to do back end web development using the popular Python Django framework. You'll build data visualization web apps using Pandas dataframes, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. You'll also work with PDF rendering and even base-64 encoding. (7 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-django-3-and-start-creating-websites-with-python/\\\n",
    "Finally, a quick update on freeCodeCamp's Data Science Curriculum Expansion. We're designing 12 new certifications that will teach advanced mathematics, computer science, and machine learning. So far 2,031 people have donated to ensure that our nonprofit has a big enough budget to hire experienced teachers. You can learn more and get involved here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-data-science-curriculum-with-advanced-math-and-machine-learning/\\\n",
